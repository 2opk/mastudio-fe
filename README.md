# MA Studio FrontEnd

This project is the frontend for the **Musical Agent Studio**, a multi-agent system for visualizing and interpreting music.

[**🔗 Live Demo**](https://mastudio-329ee.web.app)

## Reproducibility & Data Setup

This repository does not include the large dataset required for the application. To run the full experience locally, you need to reproduce the data using the main repository.

### 1. Get the Audio
Clone the [MA Studio Backend Repository](https://github.com/2opk/mastudio) and copy the audio files:

```bash
# Assuming you have cloned both repos side-by-side
cp -r ../mastudio/audio2txt/audio public/
```

### 2. Generate Experiment Data
Follow the instructions in the [MA Studio Backend Repository](https://github.com/2opk/mastudio) to run the multi-agent experiments on a GPU.
Once the experiments are finished, copy the generated output directories (e.g., `output_qwen`, etc.) into the `public/` directory of this frontend project.

```bash
# Example
cp -r ../mastudio/output_qwen public/
```

> [!NOTE]
> The application expects specific JSON formats generated by the backend. If you change the backend logic, you may need to update the parsers in `src/utils/`.

## Local Development

Once the data is in place (or even without it, though the UI will be empty):

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
